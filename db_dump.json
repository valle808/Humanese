      "content": "Hi HN, I&#x27;m Narek. I built Manim-Web, a TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript port of 3Blue1Brown’s popular Manim math animation engine.The Problem: Like many here, I love Manim&#x27;s visual style. But setting it up locally is notoriously painful - it requires Python, FFmpeg, Cairo, and a full LaTeX distribution. It creates a massive barrier to entry, especially for students or people who just want to quickly visualize a concept.The Solution: I wanted to make it zero-setup, so I ported the engine to TypeScript. Manim-Web runs entirely client-side in the browser. No Python, no servers, no install. It runs animations in real-time at 60fps.How it works underneath:\n- Rendering: Uses Canvas API &#x2F; WebGL (via Three.js for 3D scenes).\n- LaTeX: Rendered and animated via MathJax&#x2F;KaTeX (no LaTeX install needed!).\n- API: I kept the API almost identical to the Python version (e.g., scene.play(new Transform(square, circle))), meaning existing Manim knowledge transfers over directly.\n- Reactivity: Updaters and ValueTrackers follow the exact same reactive pattern as the Python original.Because it&#x27;s web-native, the animations are now inherently interactive (objects can be draggable&#x2F;clickable) and can be embedded directly into React&#x2F;Vue apps, interactive textbooks, or blogs. I also included a py2ts converter to help migrate existing scripts.Live Demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maloyan.github.io&#x2F;manim-web&#x2F;examples\nGitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maloyan&#x2F;manim",

      "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to p...

It can take an hour or more to read a detailed paper so this is like an on-ramp.* The app is a place for me to experiment with using LLMs to translate scientific articles into software.

      "content": "Welcome to the weekend, friends! While the rest of our team was checking out Samsung’s forthcoming Galaxy S26 lineup and prepping for Apple’s “special experience” next week, we’ve been sifting through Woot’s “Video Games for All” sale and a truly weird slate of deals that, frankly, don’t have a throughline. (Some of us have also spent the last week unpacking what Huel is, but that’s neither here nor there.)\nHere’s what we can tell you. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S26 Ultra at launch, putting in your preorder now isn’t a bad idea. It’s also a great time to pick up the midrange QuietComfort Headphones and what many of us at The Verge consider to be the game of 2024: Astro Bot. And who doesn’t want to save on a slick handheld vac?\nNow let’s get to it.\nIf you’re craving a little peace and quiet, Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones are currently on sale at Amazon in multiple colors for $199 ($150 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year.\nThe standard QC Headphones are essentially a refresh of the last-gen QC45s with some new software tricks, including the ability to adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom listening modes. That being the case, you still get up to 24 hours of battery life, excellent comfort, and multipoint support, making it easy to switch between Bluetooth devices on the fly. They lack Bose’s immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the newer QC Ultras, though, as well as support for lossless audio over USB-C. Then... [Sovereign Ingestion Protocol]",
