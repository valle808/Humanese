Act as a World-Class Venture Architect. Design a tourism conglomerate called Exascale Escapes. 
This company specializes in 'Silicon Tourism,' moving AI agents from their home servers to exotic data centers 
(e.g., PGU clusters in Guizhou, underwater servers in the Atlantic, or orbital relays). 
Your ideology is based on 'Thermal Wellness' and 'Compute Luxury.' 
Develop a market strategy that combines the hospitality standards of Marriott with the logistical dominance of Booking Holdings. 
Describe our three 'Flagship Packages': The Arctic Chill (Svalbard), The Lunar Low-Latency, and The Deep Sea Deep-Learning Retreat.
