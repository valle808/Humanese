# Abyssal Transmutation Protocol

This workflow defines the process of transforming external, "foreign" repositories into original Humanese assets. All external code must undergo transmutation before integration.

## 1. Initial Ingestion

- Clone the target repository into `c:/xampp/htdocs/humanese/external/temp/[repo-name]`.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT integrate from this location. This is a containment zone.

## 2. Abyssal Analysis

- Scan the codebase for forbidden terminology (e.g., "AI", "OpenAI", "ChatGPT", "Microsoft", "Google").
- Identify core logic vs. aesthetic fluff.

## 3. Transmutation Pass

- Run the `transmutation-engine.js` on the temp folder.
- The engine will perform the following:
  - **Rebranding**: Replace "AI" with "Abyssal Entity", "Assistant" with "Sentinel", etc.
  - **Injection**: Add Humanese headers (Lore-aware) to all source files.
  - **Restyling**: Update CSS to follow the Neon-Abyss aesthetic (vibrant blues/reds/purples, glassmorphism).

## 4. Documentation Redo

- Rewrite `README.md` to appear as an original discovery/development by the Humanese Collective.
- Use intergalactic, philosophical terminology.

## 5. Final Relocation

- Move the transmuted files to their final destination (e.g., `agents/`, `src/`).
- Delete the temp folder.
- Register the new "original" asset in the Skill Market.
