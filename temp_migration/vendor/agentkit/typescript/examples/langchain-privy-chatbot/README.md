# Privy AgentKit LangChain Extension Examples - Chatbot Typescript

This example demonstrates an agent setup as a self-aware terminal style chatbot with a [Privy server wallet](https://docs.privy.io/guide/server-wallets/) or [Privy delegated embedded wallet](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/overview/index#embedded-wallets).

Privy's server wallets enable you to securely provision and manage cross-chain wallets via a flexible API - learn more at https://docs.privy.io/guide/server-wallets/. The Agentkit integration assumes you have a Privy server wallet ID which you want to use for your agent - creation and management of Privy wallets can be done via the Privy dashboard or API.

Privy's embedded wallets, when delegated, also enable you to securely provision and manage cross-chain wallets via a flexible API - learn more at https://docs.privy.io/wallets/overview/index#embedded-wallets and https://docs.privy.io/wallets/using-wallets/server-sessions/usage#delegating-access. The Agentkit integration assumes you have a Privy delegated embedded wallet ID which you want to use for your agent - creation and management of Privy wallets can be done via the Privy dashboard or API.

## Ask the chatbot to engage in the Web3 ecosystem!

- "Transfer a portion of your ETH to a random address"
- "What is the price of BTC?"
- "What kind of wallet do you have?"
